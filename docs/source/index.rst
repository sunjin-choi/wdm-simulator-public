*WDM-Simulator* is a simulator framework for multi-microring wavelength allocation in the context of Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) transceivers.
With the technology presenting a unique challenge of microring arbitration, the simulator attempts to fill a gap between the conventional PHY-level link simulators and high-level architectural explorations.
The goal of this simulator is to provide a modular and scalable simulation framework for the evaluation of microring arbitration strategies.
